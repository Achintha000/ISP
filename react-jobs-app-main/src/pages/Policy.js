      A Privacy Policy is a statement or a legal document that states how a
      company or website collects, handles and processes data of its customers
      and visitors. It explicitly describes whether that information is kept
      confidential, or is shared with or sold to third parties. Personal
      information about an individual may include the following: Name Address
      Email Phone number Age Sex Marital status Race Nationality Religious
      beliefs For example, an excerpt from Pinterest's Privacy Policy agreement
      clearly describes the information Pinterest collects from its users as
      well as from any other source that users enable Pinterest to gather
      information from. The information that the user voluntarily gives includes
      names, photos, pins, likes, email address, and/or phone number etc., all
      of which is regarded as personal information. Pinterest Privacy Policy:
      When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it personal
      information clause Additionally, Pinterest also states that it collects
      user location data from mobile devices, and if someone makes a purchase on
      Pinterest, payment and contact information - including an address and
      phone number - will be collected. If users buy products or services for
      others, Pinterest gathers their contact information and shipping details,
      too. Users may also give Pinterest permission to access information that
      is shared with other websites like Facebook and Twitter by linking their
      Pinterest account with them. This information would also include
      information about their friends and followers. The account settings have
      information about how much access Pinterest has to their users' data. In
      sum, a Privacy Policy is where you let your users know all about how you
      make sure their privacy is respected by your business practices. Why you
      Need a Privacy Policy Companies or websites that handle customer
      information are required by law and third parties to publish their Privacy
      Policies on their business websites. If you own a website, web app, mobile
      app or desktop app that collects or processes user data, you most
      certainly will have to post a Privacy Policy on your website (or give
      in-app access to the full Privacy Policy agreement). Privacy is not a new
      concept. Humans have always desired privacy in their social as well as
      private lives. But the idea of privacy as a human right is a relatively
      modern phenomenon. Around the world, laws and regulations have been
      developed for the protection of data related to government, education,
      health, children, consumers, financial institutions, etc. This data is
      critical to the person it belongs to. From credit card numbers and social
      security numbers to email addresses and phone numbers, our sensitive,
      personally identifiable information is important. This sort of information
      in unreliable hands can potentially have far-reaching consequences. There
      are several reasons for a website to post its Privacy Policy agreement on
      its website. Here are some of the main reasons: Required by the law
      Required by third party services Increases Transparency Let's take a look
      at each of these reasons in more depth. A Privacy Policy is Required by
      the Law For individuals to feel comfortable sharing their personal
      information on the internet, there should be some sort of legal
      responsibility on businesses to protect that data and keep the users
      informed about the status and health of their information. Countries
      around the world have realized the need to protect their citizens' data
      and privacy. Businesses and websites that collect and/or process customer
      information are required to publish and abide by a Privacy Policy
      agreement. A majority of countries have already enacted laws to protect
      their users' data security and privacy. These laws require businesses to
      obtain explicit consent from users whose data they will store or process.
      A few of these laws include the following: CalOPPA in the USA GDPR in the
      EU PIPEDA in Canada For a business or a website that collects and
      processes user information in a certain region or country, it is very
      important to have complete knowledge of the data and privacy protection
      laws enforced in that region and the region your customers and end users
      are in. Non-compliance with these laws can result in hefty fines or even
      prosecution against the violator. In some cases, businesses have to follow
      laws specific to states or regulations specific to industries. For
      example, here's how General Motors complies with CalOPPA in the US by
      including a California-specific section in its Privacy Policy:
